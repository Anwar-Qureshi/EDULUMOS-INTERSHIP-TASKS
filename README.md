**Intern:** Mohammed Anwar Qureshi
**Task:** Task 02 - Linear Regression using a Simple Dataset

---

## 1. Project Goal

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features of the property and its location. This was accomplished using Python and the Scikit-learn library.

## 2. Project Workflow

The project followed a standard data science workflow:
1.  **Data Loading & Initial Inspection:** Loaded the USA Housing dataset and checked for data quality.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized the data to understand relationships, distributions, and correlations, particularly with the `Price`.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Prepared the data for modeling by separating features and target, and splitting them into training and testing sets.
4.  **Model Building & Training:** Built and trained a Linear Regression model.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance on unseen data, achieving an **R-squared score of over 91%**.
6.  **Prediction:** Used the final trained model to predict the price of a hypothetical new house.

## 3. Tools and Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.

## 4. Key Visualization

The scatter plot below shows a strong linear relationship between the actual house prices and the prices predicted by the model, confirming its high accuracy.
